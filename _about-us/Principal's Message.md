**Principal's Message for 2024**

Dear Parents and Guardians,  

A heartfelt welcome to 2024 and back to Qihua!  
  
I hope that everyone has had a rejuvenating holiday, meaningfully spent to build bonds with the family members and to pursue an interest. The Qihua staff are thrilled to welcome our Qihuaians back and to engage them in another enriching year of learning and discovery.

In Qihua, learning experiences are mindfully designed to develop our childrenâ€™s strengths, to empower them to create values for themselves and to connect with others. We hope to nurture Qihuaians into individuals who have a positive mindset and are able to exercise self-regulation and awareness. This is possible because of the robust support network consisting of staff, parents and the students themselves. Qihuaians will be given the opportunities to learn to become individuals who are sensitive to the feelings of others and are capable of establishing friendly bonds with their peers and support them, when the need arises. In the process, they will gain confidence as they witness how their personal achievements lead to collective contributions and in the process, seeding the spirit of volunteerism. They will, in the future, become active contributors to the society.

Technology remains a cornerstone in our teaching and learning practices. Positive digital habits, especially in the area of device usage, need to be inculcated to ensure that the well-being of our children are not compromised. We will continue to work hand-in-hand with parents to instill responsibility and good life habits in our students so that they can benefit optimally from the affordances of technology.

It is important for our children to be connected with the world by staying informed about current affairs. Parents are encouraged to use daily happenings and global affairs as conversational points with your children to broaden their worldviews and ignite their curiosity towards the global society.

I look forward to working with you to guide our children to embrace curiosity and find joy as they embark on a new year of learning in Qihua. Together, we will make 2024 a rewarding year for our little ones.
