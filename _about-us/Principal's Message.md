**Principal's Message for 2024**


<img src="/images/About Us/Mrs-Lee-365x600.jpeg" style="width:200px;height:300px;">


Dear Parents and Guardians,  

A heartfelt welcome to 2024 and back to Qihua!  
  
I hope that everyone has had a rejuvenating holiday, meaningfully spent to build bonds with the family members and to pursue an interest. The Qihua staff are thrilled to welcome our Qihuaians back and to engage them in another enriching year of learning and discovery.

In Qihua, learning experiences are mindfully designed to develop our children’s strengths, to empower them to create values for themselves and to connect with others. We hope to nurture Qihuaians into individuals who have a positive mindset and are able to exercise self-regulation and awareness. This is possible because of the robust support network consisting of staff, parents and the students themselves. Qihuaians will be given the opportunities to learn to become individuals who are sensitive to the feelings of others and are capable of establishing friendly bonds with their peers and support them, when the need arises. In the process, they will gain confidence as they witness how their personal achievements lead to collective contributions and in the process, seeding the spirit of volunteerism. They will, in the future, become active contributors to the society.

Technology remains a cornerstone in our teaching and learning practices. Positive digital habits, especially in the area of device usage, need to be inculcated to ensure that the well-being of our children are not compromised. We will continue to work hand-in-hand with parents to instill responsibility and good life habits in our students so that they can benefit optimally from the affordances of technology.

It is important for our children to be connected with the world by staying informed about current affairs. Parents are encouraged to use daily happenings and global affairs as conversational points with your children to broaden their worldviews and ignite their curiosity towards the global society.

I look forward to working with you to guide our children to embrace curiosity and find joy as they embark on a new year of learning in Qihua. Together, we will make 2024 a rewarding year for our little ones.

亲爱的家长们、监护人们

衷心欢迎2024年的到来，欢迎大家回到启化！

我希望家长和孩子们都度过了一个充满活力的假期，与家人增进了感情，追求着自己的兴趣爱好。启化全体教职员热烈欢迎我们的启化学子们返校，并将引导他们在崭新的一年中学习和探索。

在启化，我们精心设计学习体验，以培养孩子们的专长，赋予他们创造自我价值和与他人联结沟通的能力。我们希望启化学子能够成长为心态积极、有自我约束能力和有觉悟有意识的个体。在启化，我们拥有一个由教职员、家长和学生共同构建起来的强大的支持网络，这个网络会让我们实现共同的愿望。学生们将有机会，学习如何成为一个具备同理心的人，能够与同学建立友好的关系并在有需要的时候帮助他人。在这个过程中，学生们将见证到自己个人的努力如何汇集成集体的力量，从而成为更自信的人。同时，在学生们的心中也会播撒下志愿者精神的种子。未来，他们将会成为对社会做出积极贡献的人。

科技仍然是我校教学和学习实践的立足点。学生们需要具备数码素养，尤其要培养他们在电子设备使用方面上的良好习惯，以确保孩子们的身心不会受到负面的影响。我们将继续与家长携手合作，向学生灌输责任感和良好的生活习惯，让他们能够最大程度地从科技的可供性中受益。

通过了解时事，让孩子们能走出校园，走进世界。我鼓励家长们把日常事件和全球时事当作话题，与孩子们交流看法，以扩大他们的世界观并激发他们对国际社会的好奇心，从而培养他们对国际社会、周遭环境关注和关怀的态度。

我期待与您的密切合作，共同引导我们的孩子怀着好奇心，在启化新学年的学习过程中找到乐趣。让我们共同努力，让2024年成为孩子们的丰收之年。
<br>
