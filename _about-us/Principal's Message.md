Dear Parents,  
  
Welcome to 2023 and back to Qihua!  
  
I hope that the December school holidays have brought about ample opportunities for our Qihuaians to forge valuable bonds with their family members and pursue a burning passion. I am sure they are now well-recharged for another year of exciting learning.

In 2022, we saw the nation moving towards normalcy, making possible the return of school experiences like learning journeys, the P5 camp, national competitions etc. I am pleased to share that almost all the school programmes will be back in full swing in 2023 and those will include the various camps and the P3 SwimSafer Programme. With adherence to the Safe Management Measures, we would be able to give our Qihuaians a complete and comprehensive set of school experiences.

We have learnt and grown so much from the pandemic for the past three years. It enabled us to see opportunities to tap on technology to cultivate students’ self-directness and arouse their excitement in learning. Qihua started our distinctive EAGLETS Programme in 2020 and this year will be our fourth round of implementation. Through EAGLETS, we aim to mould Qihuaians into responsible technology users and active learners who take ownership of their own learning. Our Qihuaians learn and put into action the SOAR (Set goals, Organise time, Act responsibly, Reflect deeply) habits under the guidance of the teachers on EAGLETS Day held in school and continue to apply them to manage their own learning during EAGLETS Day at home. The EAGLETS learning activities have been mindfully planned to give our learners more autonomy on what they would like to learn. An example includes the Wonder Hour where Qihuaians are encouraged to be curious about what is beyond the textbook.

One event that we will all be looking forward to is our 85th Anniversary. Qihua is indeed honoured to celebrate our 85 years of success and rich heritage. We would like to extend our invitation and show our appreciation to our alumnae, parents, community partners and many well-wishes who have been so generous with your support. As a school in the community, Qihua would like to celebrate the event with the community, giving our children a chance to share with and reach out to the residents. There will be a series of programmes and a main celebration event in July and let’s look forward to a meaningful celebration.

Moving on, Qihua will continue to partner our parents, alumnae and community closely to provide rich learning experiences for the students through a wholesome curriculum anchored in values, to prepare our students for the future.

Principal
