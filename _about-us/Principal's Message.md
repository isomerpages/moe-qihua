<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p></p>
<p>A very warm welcome to 2026!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the holidays were a time of joy, rest, and meaningful moments with
your loved ones. As we begin this new academic year, we are excited to
build on the strong foundations we have laid together over the past two
years. If 2025 was about planting seeds—nurturing a <strong>positive school culture</strong> and
introducing key <strong>21st-century competencies</strong>—then 2026 will
be about deepening those roots and helping them flourish.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of our main priorities this year is the <strong>Future of Learning</strong>.
With technology and Artificial Intelligence advancing rapidly, we want
to guide our students to use these tools thoughtfully—to support their
learning, not learning for them. Through our EAGLETS programme and the <strong>SOAR</strong> learning
routines (Set targets, Organise resources, Act, Reflect), our Qihuaians
are becoming more reflective and self-directed learners. They are learning
to understand where they are, where they want to go, and how to get there—not
just in academics, but in discovering their personal strengths and passions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While learning evolves, our <strong>values </strong>remain timeless. In
preparing our students for the future, we will never lose sight of the
essentials: <strong>strong literacy and numeracy</strong>, and a foundation
of <strong>good character</strong>. We aim to raise Qihuaians with kind
hearts—children who show compassion to themselves, their families, and
the wider community. By learning to empathise and put others before self,
they will <strong>be a blessing</strong> who make a positive difference.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are deeply grateful for your <strong>trust and partnership</strong>.
Your support goes far beyond attending school events—it shines through
in the way you reinforce our values at home. Whether it is encouraging
your children to resolve differences independently or asking questions
that spark curiosity, these everyday moments help them develop critical
thinking, communication, and ownership of their learning. These small acts
are like quiet building blocks, laying a strong foundation for their future.</p>
<p>
<br>Thank you for walking this journey with us. I look forward to another
year of <strong>collaboration</strong> as we shape confident, compassionate,
and future-ready learners together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<p><strong>Mrs Lee Hui Feng,</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Principal of Qihua Pri Sch</strong>
