<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>A warm welcome to 2025 and another exciting year at Qihua!</p>
<p>I trust that the recent holiday season has been a time of rest and rejuvenation,
providing opportunities to create cherished memories with family and pursue
personal interests. The Qihua staff are excited to welcome our Qihuaians
back and look forward to embarking on another fulfilling year of growth,
learning, and discovery together.</p>
<p>In Qihua, we remain committed to nurturing our students holistically,
empowering them to embrace challenges, celebrate progress, and forge meaningful
connections. This year, we will place focus on fostering a positive school
culture where every student is encouraged to adopt a growth mindset. We
would like our Qihuaians to see the best in themselves and others, approach
challenges with confidence, and view setbacks as opportunities for learning
and improvement. Through the use of positive language and supportive interactions
among peers, and with parents and staff as role models, we aim to create
an environment where our students feel safe, valued, and inspired to grow.</p>
<p>Another key focus for 2025 is the development of emerging 21st-century
competencies that prepare our students for an ever-evolving world. Beyond
academic content, we are committed to equipping Qihuaians with essential
skills such as critical thinking, inventive problem-solving, effective
communication, and collaboration. Through our school programmes like our
Applied Learning Programme, EAGLETS, and our day-to-day teaching practices,
we will strengthen inquiry-based learning by encouraging collaborative
learning and integrating visible thinking strategies.</p>
<p>Our continued emphasis on values, coupled with this yearâ€™s focuses on
building a positive learning environment and cultivating future-ready competencies,
will ensure that Qihuaians thrive holistically. Together, we will nurture
their character, broaden their perspectives, and spark their curiosity,
empowering them to contribute meaningfully to community.</p>
<p>I look forward to partnering with you to make 2025 a remarkable year for
our children. Thank you for your trust and unwavering support in this shared
journey of shaping our young learners into confident, compassionate, and
capable individuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<p><b>Mrs Lee Hui Feng</b></p>
Principal
