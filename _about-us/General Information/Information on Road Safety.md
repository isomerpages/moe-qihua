**Advisory on Road safety for Parents**

Parents should set a good example to ensure children remain safe and develop road and traffic awareness. Parents are advised to follow these simple guide when crossing the road with their child.

**On the pavement**

When walking near a road it is a good to:

*   hold your child’s hand – don’t let them run ahead.
*   look out for and be aware of hidden entrances or driveways crossing the pavement.
*   make sure your child walks on the side of the pavement away from the traffic.

**Crossing the road**

When crossing the road, remember to:

*   tell your child that it’s safest to cross at a pedestrian crossing or traffic lights.
*   tell your child not to cross where they can’t see far along the road.
*   explain that they should not try to cross a road between parked cars; drivers won’t be able to see them very well and the cars might start moving.
*   when it’s safe to cross, walk straight across the road and keep looking and listening out for traffic.
*   remind your children to concentrate – they may be easily distracted, forget what they have been taught and dash out into the road.

**Pedestrian crossings**

Pedestrian crossings are safe, but they can still be dangerous for children if they don’t take care. Remember to:

*   explain that pedestrians have to wait on the pavement until all the traffic coming from both directions has stopped – only then it is safe to cross.
*   explain that if there is an island in the middle of the road, your child should treat each half of the crossing as a separate crossing.
*   tell your child it’s important to keep looking and listening while crossing, in case a driver has not seen them.
*   warn your child to watch for cyclists or motorcyclists who might not have seen them.
*   always use a pedestrian-crosing or light-controlled crossing.
