**SCHOOL RULES AND REGULATIONS**

**QHPS rules are based on our school values.**                                                              

All Qihuaians must demonstrate through their daily behaviour, their understanding and internalization of the six school values – Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Teamwork (R³ICT).

Outside the school, Qihuaians should also remember to project the good name of the school by behaving properly and observing traffic rules. They should also be courteous and considerate to all members of the public when they are in public places.

**School Uniform**

**Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform and modification to the uniform is not allowed.**
