**P4 – Make the Change**

P4 students attended a Social Entrepreneurship Innovation Programme, Make-The-Change which helped students to recognise the various social issues faced in our communities. This programme inculcated positive values and habits through exposure to real life situations and case studies. Students were then given the opportunity to actualise their innovative solutions through a social campaign based on design thinking skills.

**P5 – Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) – Micro:bit**

Our P5 students discovered for themselves the magic of coding and the joy in inventing products of their imagination. During the project, our futuristic young wizards battled with time to innovate and invent products! They toggled with the micro:bit codings and brainstormed for ideas to build fitness products and design games for varying target groups. They whisked through the design thinking process to integrate micro:bit with their designs.
