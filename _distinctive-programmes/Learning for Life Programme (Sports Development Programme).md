**<font size=6>Learning for Life Programme</font>**

**Objectives**

The Sports Development Programme (SDP) is Qihua’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP). The guiding principle of SDP is that positive values and life-skills associated with sporting pursuits and success can be directly taught, nurtured and learnt. Through this programme,  students can be developed into athletes of good character and be valued members who would contribute to a healthy and sporty society.

**Overview**

The SDP is anchored on school values and focuses on creating social interaction. It provides ideal opportunities for students of different races, nationalities and social backgrounds to hone their Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) competencies such as relationship management, self and social awareness. Students would have opportunities to recognise and manage their emotions, develop care and concern for others, make responsible decisions, establish positive relationships, as well as handle challenging situations effectively. Hence, opportunities are also created for students to develop the 21st Century Competencies of Civic Literacy and Cross-cultural skills.

**Key programmes**

1.  **Lower Primary Games Day**

Students compete in a series of games that require them to use the fundamental movement skills and modified games taught. School values such as teamwork, respect and resilience are emphasised.
