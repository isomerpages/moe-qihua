**<font size=6>Learning for Life Programme</font>**

**Objectives**

The Sports Development Programme (SDP) is Qihua’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP). The guiding principle of SDP is that positive values and life-skills associated with sporting pursuits and success can be directly taught, nurtured and learnt. Through this programme,  students can be developed into athletes of good character and be valued members who would contribute to a healthy and sporty society.

**Overview**

The SDP is anchored on school values and focuses on creating social interaction. It provides ideal opportunities for students of different races, nationalities and social backgrounds to hone their Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) competencies such as relationship management, self and social awareness. Students would have opportunities to recognise and manage their emotions, develop care and concern for others, make responsible decisions, establish positive relationships, as well as handle challenging situations effectively. Hence, opportunities are also created for students to develop the 21st Century Competencies of Civic Literacy and Cross-cultural skills.

**Key programmes**

1.  **Lower Primary Games Day**

Students compete in a series of games that require them to use the fundamental movement skills and modified games taught. School values such as teamwork, respect and resilience are emphasised.

**2\. P3 to P6 Inter-house Games Day**

All P3 to P6 students have the opportunity to take part in Inter-house games. Each level will have a friendly inter-house competition based on two or three sport(s) which they have learnt for the year. This is an extension of the school efforts to build positive student-teacher relationship and bonding among the students. Form Teachers will be present at the games to help organise and support the students. It is through such activities that talented players are also spotted by the relevant sports related CCA teachers. School values such as teamwork, integrity and resilience are emphasised in this programme.

**4\. Sports Camp**

The Sports camp aims to provide student athletes with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values, cultivate positive attitudes and life skills. Team building activities, learning journeys and sports preparatory workshops foster team spirit and camaraderie among student athletes in the various Sports CCAs. In addition through the Sports camp, student athletes build up confidence and resilience, develop leadership skills and acquire life skills and knowledge to better prepare themselves physically and mentally for competitions which allow them to expand their skills to be a well-rounded athlete.
