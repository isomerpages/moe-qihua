<h2><strong>EAGLETS</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Objectives</strong></h3>
<p>The school introduced the EAGLETS – Empowering All Growing LEarners To
Soar programme in 2020 to focus on building self-direction among our students.
The students have experienced full Home-Based Learning (HBL) during the
circuit breaker. The experience showed that they could and should learn
independently, regardless of the mode of learning. Extending from that
HBL experience, we want our students to continue developing themselves
as independent learners.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Features of the Programme</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>S.O.A.R</strong></h4>
<p>One prominent feature of the programme is to devote time to build the
S.O.A.R habits – Set goals, Organise time, Act responsibly, Reflect deeply.
Students begin each EAGLETS Day by learning to set learning goals and plan
their personal learning timetable. At the end of the day, they reflect
on what they have learned and how they can learn better. The teachers have
tried their best to imbue discipline among our students with these learning
habits, which we believe will set them up for independent learning.</p>
<h4><strong>EAGLETS in school and at home</strong></h4>
<p>Another feature of the programme is that the EAGLETS Days are carried
out both in school and at home. As students build familiarity and confidence
in school, they will be in a better stead to manage their own learning
at home. Through this programme, we hope that parents find that their children
are more able to cope with HBL independently.</p>
