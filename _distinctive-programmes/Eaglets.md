**<font size=6>EAGLETS</font>**

**<font size=5>Objectives</font>**

The school introduced the EAGLETS – Empowering All Growing LEarners To Soar programme in 2020 to focus on building self-direction among our students. The students have experienced full Home-Based Learning (HBL) during the circuit breaker. The experience showed that they could and should learn independently, regardless of the mode of learning. Extending from that HBL experience, we want our students to continue developing themselves as independent learners.

**<font size=5>Features of the programme</font>**

**S.O.A.R**

One prominent feature of the programme is to devote time to build the S.O.A.R habits – Set goals, Organise time, Act responsibly, Reflect deeply. Students begin each EAGLETS Day by learning to set learning goals and plan their personal learning timetable. At the end of the day, they reflect on what they have learned and how they can learn better. The teachers have tried their best to imbue discipline among our students with these learning habits, which we believe will set them up for independent learning.

**EAGLETS in school and at home**

Another feature of the programme is that the EAGLETS Days are carried out both in school and at home. As students build familiarity and confidence in school, they will be in a better stead to manage their own learning at home. Through this programme, we hope that parents find that their children are more able to cope with HBL independently.
