**<font size=6>School Bag and Back Care Advice</font>**

The school takes the well-being and physical development of students seriously and proactively guides students in lightening their school bags.

Students are reminded to pack according to their daily timetables. There are also lockers in our school for students to keep what they need in class on each day of the week.

Ministry guidelines stipulate that a child should carry a bag that weighs no more than 10 per cent to 15 per cent of his/her weight.

**Tips to lighten the load**

The following steps should help reduce the load on the spine and shoulder muscles.

*   Clean out your backpack once a week so unnecessary items are not left inside.
*   Pack the biggest and heaviest objects in the bag first. If the bag has internal elastic bands, use these to strap the heavy items closer together and towards the body.
*   Fill the compartments so the load is evenly distributed throughout the backpack and the items do not shift during movement.
*   Always use both straps together (one on each shoulder). Dangling the bag from one shoulder (and usually the same shoulder) will cause an uneven load on the spine.
*   Adjust the straps until the bag’s base rests on the pelvis. If there is a pelvis strap, snap it on snugly.
*   Carry only one other item separately – for example, a water bottle or an art supplies bag.
*   Both hands should be free to hold support (such as staircase railings) and to allow balance and break a fall.
