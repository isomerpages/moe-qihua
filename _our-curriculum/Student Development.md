<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Empowered Qihuaians: Confident Learners who Lead with Heart, Serve with
Purpose, and Grow Together</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>To develop every Qihuaian into a responsible and caring individual, equipped
with the skills and values to lead, serve and thrive.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Empowering Confident Leaders</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Student Leadership Development Framework</strong> is firmly
grounded on values and character education. Anchored on the belief that
“Every student is a leader at different levels of competency”, the school
adopts a three-tiered Student Leadership Development Programme (SLDP) to
develop leadership in all students:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Foundational Leadership Development Programme</strong> to develop
the personal leadership skills in every student to lead self.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Experiential Leadership Development Programme</strong> to develop
leadership skills to lead others within the classroom.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Strategic Leadership Development Programme</strong> with specific
leadership training to further develop and enhance their leadership skills
to lead others at the cohort or school level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A systematic approach is adopted in identifying, training, monitoring
and evaluating students’ leadership development.&nbsp; At the foundational
level, students form class committees (Classroom Enhancement, Classroom
Cleanliness, Classroom Energy Conservation, Classroom Safety). At the experiential
level, class leadership is structured to ensure that each child assumes
a leadership role every year. Processes are put in place to ensure every
pupil has a chance to assume responsibility as a Subject Monitor or as
Group Leaders. Through the experience gained at the experiential leadership
tier, teachers will identify students with higher potential to be put into
customized strategic leadership programmes to develop and maximize their
potential.</p>
<p>Through the SLDP, we hope to see all our students exhibit the following
leadership skills:</p>
<p>&nbsp;(a) <strong>Foundational Leadership</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>

<h3><strong>Positive Discipline</strong></h3>
<p>With the Positive Discipline approach, students learn positive behaviour
through the teaching of values, social-emotional and life skills, and by
being given opportunities to practise and reinforce these behaviours. This
approach focuses on building respectful relationships, setting clear expectations,
and supporting students in developing self-control, accountability, and
responsible decision-making. The aim is to foster a safe, inclusive, and
supportive learning environment where students feel valued and are motivated
to learn and grow from their experiences. Peer relationships play a key
role in encouraging positive influence and providing emotional and social
support.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Disciplinary measures are designed to help students understand the consequences
of inappropriate actions and take responsibility to make better choices
in the future. The school works in partnership with parents to maintain
consistent behavioural standards through ongoing collaboration and communication.
Restorative practices are integrated to promote empathy, open dialogue,
and mutual understanding among students and staff. For example, student
counselling and guided reflection sessions are used to repair and strengthen
relationships that may have been affected by behavioural issues.</p>
<h3><strong>Positive Experiences at Lower, Middle and Upper Primary</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Lower Primary</strong></h4>
