**<font size=5>Engaging the mass</font>**

 
**Growth Mindset**

Students have embarked on a journey to learn about the Growth mindset through game play in the morning. Pre-morning game sessions have been developed to help students discover the differences between Growth and Fixed mindsets. Through discovering the differences, the students will understand that they have a choice to adopt a Growth mindset. Individuals with growth mindsets are more likely to embrace challenges, persevere in the face of obstacles and as a result, they can achieve more.

**Inclusivity Education in PSR**

  
In promoting inclusivity of students with SEN and deepening the culture of care, inclusive education is driven through our Peer Support and Relationship programme (PSR). PSR is an all-year programme where lessons are carried out during CCE, FTGP and termly Start It Right (SIR) sessions. Storytelling approach is adopted to promote PSR messages and social skills during SIR.

**Bully Free Zone**

  
As part of the school’s efforts to promote the message of anti-bullying, various activities were organised, targeting different groups of students. Students from IBEEP and selected student leaders participated in a workshop and camp as part of their learning and in empowering them, as anti-bullying advocates, to lead their peers in championing for a bully free zone. This group of students, together with some personnels from Singapore Children’s Society, organised an anti-bullying campaign and led in promoting bully-free messages to their peers. Awareness to the general student population was carried out through an assembly programme and activities that were planned during the different recesses.
