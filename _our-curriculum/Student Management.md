**Growth Mindset**

Students have embarked on a journey to learn about the Growth mindset through game play in the morning. Pre-morning game sessions have been developed to help students discover the differences between Growth and Fixed mindsets. Through discovering the differences, the students will understand that they have a choice to adopt a Growth mindset. Individuals with growth mindsets are more likely to embrace challenges, persevere in the face of obstacles and as a result, they can achieve more.

**Inclusivity Education in PSR**

  
In promoting inclusivity of students with SEN and deepening the culture of care, inclusive education is driven through our Peer Support and Relationship programme (PSR). PSR is an all-year programme where lessons are carried out during CCE, FTGP and termly Start It Right (SIR) sessions. Storytelling approach is adopted to promote PSR messages and social skills during SIR.

**Bully Free Zone**

  
As part of the school’s efforts to promote the message of anti-bullying, various activities were organised, targeting different groups of students. Students from IBEEP and selected student leaders participated in a workshop and camp as part of their learning and in empowering them, as anti-bullying advocates, to lead their peers in championing for a bully free zone. This group of students, together with some personnels from Singapore Children’s Society, organised an anti-bullying campaign and led in promoting bully-free messages to their peers. Awareness to the general student population was carried out through an assembly programme and activities that were planned during the different recesses.

**P6 Motivation workshop**

  
While striving for academic success, it is equally important to care for our students’ well-being. At Qihua, the teachers look into equipping our Primary 6 students with the skills and motivation to handle the stresses of being a PSLE candidate.

As part of our continuing efforts, we conducted a 3-day workshop where students focused on reviewing their target setting and time management, as well as practising effective study skills. In the months to come, we will continue to support the students and motivate them. With determination and follow-through, the goals they have set for themselves can be achieved!

**Learning and Leading from within**

  
From face-to-face sessions to online workshops, our prefects are continuously provided with opportunities to be trained and developed in their leadership qualities and skills. For example, the senior prefects from Primary 6, mentor and train the Primary 5 prefects to lead the school, especially for the morning assembly.It is hoped that this on-the-job training will hone their leadership qualities and skills further.

**Enriching the learning experiences**

  
**TOUCH (Time-out Under Caring Hands)**

  
TOUCH encompasses various identified after-school programmes (IBEEP, MUM, CHiCS) that look into students’ well-being. Its aim is to provide a safe and supportive environment for students to be meaningfully engaged during and after school hours, at the same time, develop trusting and warm relationships through conversations and play with peers and adult-mentors.

  
Interest-based experiential elective programme (IBEEP) is an after school enrichment programme with the purpose of providing students with consistent and regular interest-based activities, an opportunity to build self-esteem and develop talent in areas of interest.

  
Champion in Community Service (ChiCS) is a programme that enables students to experience the spirit of giving back and contribute to society through available community initiatives.

  
Mentors Uplift Me (MUM) is a mentoring programme which supports selected students through their primary school journey, tapping on the strength of strong TSR, committed teacher individuals and dedicated volunteers from our community partners.

**Interest-Based Experiential Elective Programme (IBEEP)**

  
IBEEP is an after-school enrichment programme that offers students consistent and regular interest-based activities. This programme provides opportunities to build self-esteem and develop talent in areas of interest within a safe and conducive environment.

**There are 3 parts to IBEEP:**

  
**Partners’ Programme**

  
As part of the programme, the school engages external agencies such as YGOS and  
Mendaki to mentor and lead the students in values-inculcation activities.

**Experiential Electives**

  
Students attend workshops or training sessions based on their areas of interest. Electives offered include Kickboxing, Cooking, Photography, Coding, Trampoline Workout, Inline Skating and Taiko Drumming.

**IBEEP Room**

  
A room has been refurbished to be the place for students to do self-studying, reading and playing games with peers under the supervision of our support staff.

IBEEP received positive responses from the students. Through this platform, they have been supported in their journey of self-discovery. Being able to explore their interests has made coming to school so much more engaging and fun!

**Heartware Reading and Tuition Programme**

  
Qihua engaged Heartware Network, a charitable youth organisation, to provide targeted support to a small group of students. The selected lower primary students went through The Heartware Learning Together Programme where the volunteers used online platforms to engage students in one-on-one lessons to improve their literacy skills through language activities. Through these activities students expand their vocabulary, acquire comprehension skills and improve their reading ability. Volunteers use stories, songs, video clips to arouse interest and engage students.  
The tuition programme aims to enhance academic interest and motivation in our graduating students. A select group of P6 students were selected to participate in the 2020 Heartware programme. Supported by student volunteers from tertiary institutions, our students had weekly coaching sessions for Math. The sessions not only helped to boost the self- esteem and confidence of our students, but the volunteers served as good role models to them.

**<font size=5>Service Leadership</font>**

  
**Voice of Qihua**

Voice of Qihua is a platform for students to voice out their thoughts and give them a sense of ownership towards the development of the school. Once a term, selected prefects present a problem that they have noticed around the school and share their observation during assembly. They then guide their peers to provide solutions and those that can be implemented will be shared with the school.

**Strategic Student Leadership**

  
As a Strategic Leader in Qihua, one aims to lead and inspire. Our Strategic Leaders undergo self development training to master skills such as Public speaking and Conflict Management. At the same time, they would be given opportunities to contribute towards the betterment of the school. One of such opportunities would be partnering with Northwest CDC in serving the community.

In line with WeCare @ North West – Service Weeks, North West CDC organised a festive distribution to needy families from 22 January to 07 February 2021. Each year, the NWCDC will distribute festive goodies bags for identified households and Qihua Primary School was part of the action in spreading festive cheers to our needy families this year. Selected Primary 6 student leaders and IBEEP students managed to pack 150 goodies bags in a record time of two hours! They worked as a team and enjoyed the experience in their effort to give back to the community.

For their continuous effort and contribution, a ceremony called the Student Leaders’ Investiture is held yearly. This is held to reaffirm the commitment and recognise the contribution of our student leaders such as the prefects and Co-curricular leaders, in our school. Last year for the first time, we streamed the event to the whole school. During the investiture, we introduced our newly appointed prefects and the Prefect Executive Committee for 2021. We also acknowledge the contribution of our P6 prefects through the years that they had rendered their invaluable services to the school. To start off this memorable event, we had our former Head Prefect of 2019, Azizy, to share with us his experience as a leader in Qihua and how it has helped him grow as a leader in his current school. We had a special handing over ceremony where the current co-curricular leaders handed over a symbolic item, representing their CCAs, to the incumbent leaders.

  
We hope to inspire our students to be future leaders in their own rights, leading self and others.
