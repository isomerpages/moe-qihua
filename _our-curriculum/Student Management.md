**Growth Mindset**

Students have embarked on a journey to learn about the Growth mindset through game play in the morning. Pre-morning game sessions have been developed to help students discover the differences between Growth and Fixed mindsets. Through discovering the differences, the students will understand that they have a choice to adopt a Growth mindset. Individuals with growth mindsets are more likely to embrace challenges, persevere in the face of obstacles and as a result, they can achieve more.
