**Growth Mindset**

Students have embarked on a journey to learn about the Growth mindset through game play in the morning. Pre-morning game sessions have been developed to help students discover the differences between Growth and Fixed mindsets. Through discovering the differences, the students will understand that they have a choice to adopt a Growth mindset. Individuals with growth mindsets are more likely to embrace challenges, persevere in the face of obstacles and as a result, they can achieve more.

**Inclusivity Education in PSR**

  
In promoting inclusivity of students with SEN and deepening the culture of care, inclusive education is driven through our Peer Support and Relationship programme (PSR). PSR is an all-year programme where lessons are carried out during CCE, FTGP and termly Start It Right (SIR) sessions. Storytelling approach is adopted to promote PSR messages and social skills during SIR.

**Bully Free Zone**

  
As part of the school’s efforts to promote the message of anti-bullying, various activities were organised, targeting different groups of students. Students from IBEEP and selected student leaders participated in a workshop and camp as part of their learning and in empowering them, as anti-bullying advocates, to lead their peers in championing for a bully free zone. This group of students, together with some personnels from Singapore Children’s Society, organised an anti-bullying campaign and led in promoting bully-free messages to their peers. Awareness to the general student population was carried out through an assembly programme and activities that were planned during the different recesses.

**P6 Motivation workshop**

  
While striving for academic success, it is equally important to care for our students’ well-being. At Qihua, the teachers look into equipping our Primary 6 students with the skills and motivation to handle the stresses of being a PSLE candidate.

As part of our continuing efforts, we conducted a 3-day workshop where students focused on reviewing their target setting and time management, as well as practising effective study skills. In the months to come, we will continue to support the students and motivate them. With determination and follow-through, the goals they have set for themselves can be achieved!

**Learning and Leading from within**

  
From face-to-face sessions to online workshops, our prefects are continuously provided with opportunities to be trained and developed in their leadership qualities and skills. For example, the senior prefects from Primary 6, mentor and train the Primary 5 prefects to lead the school, especially for the morning assembly.It is hoped that this on-the-job training will hone their leadership qualities and skills further.

IBEEP received positive responses from the students. Through this platform, they have been supported in their journey of self-discovery. Being able to explore their interests has made coming to school so much more engaging and fun!
