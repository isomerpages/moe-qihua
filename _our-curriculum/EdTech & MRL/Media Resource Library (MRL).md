<h3><strong>Library Activities &amp; Programmes</strong></h3>
<p>Our <strong>Media Resource Library</strong> is a vibrant hub of learning
and discovery. We offer a variety of programmes designed to ignite a lifelong
passion for reading and equip students with essential 21st-century literacy
skills.</p>
<h4><strong>Engaging the Mass</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Bringing Books to Our Students</strong>
</p>
<p>Fostering a joy for reading is central to our school's curriculum, and
we create many opportunities for students to connect with books.</p>
<p>As a key part of the English and Mother Tongue reading programmes, each
class visits the library once a term. These dedicated periods are a highlight
for students, offering them time to be lost in our collection, discover
new authors, and enjoy engaging activities that bring stories to life.</p>
<p>To ensure a great book is always within reach, our dedicated Library Ambassadors
run a popular mobile library during morning assembly. Furthermore, the
library is a key partner in major school events like the English Language
Fiesta and Mother Tongue Fortnight, where we curate special displays to
connect students with books relevant to the festivities.</p>

<br><strong>Online Reading &amp; Research Platforms</strong>
</p>
<p>To build future-ready skills, we empower our students to navigate the
digital world of information effectively. We introduce them to key online
platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>School Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC):</strong> This catalogue
allows students to easily search for all the books and resources available
in our school library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>School E-Resource Repository (SERR):</strong> This is our virtual
library, providing students with access to a wide range of e-books, articles,
and other multimodal resources to extend their learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these tools, students develop crucial digital literacy skills
and can access a world of reading and research anytime, anywhere.</p>
<h4><strong>Enriching the Learning experiences</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Library Week</strong>
</p>
<p>Library Week is an annual, school-wide celebration of reading! This exciting
week is packed with special events, author visits, and competitions designed
to foster a strong reading culture and highlight the rich resources our
library</p>
<p>offers to the entire school community.</p>
