**Engaging the mass**

**Tamil Language Festival**

  
Tamil Language month is officially commemorated in Singapore during the month of April every year since 2007. The Tamil Language Festival (TLF) was first organized in 2007, aimed at encouraging the Tamil community in Singapore to use the language in their daily lives. The festival is a community effort supported by Tamil organisations, community partners and other agencies. This year, due to Covid restrictions, Woodlands CC organized a virtual Tamil Language Festival. The virtual festival features literary, oratorical and cultural programmes, with “Love Tamil, Speak Tamil” as the theme. The occasion was specially graced by Ms Mariam Jaafar, Grassroots advisor for Woodlands. Some of our Qihuaians participated in the story telling, Tamil poems and proverbs (Thirukkural) recitation competition.
