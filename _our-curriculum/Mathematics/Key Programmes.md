**<font size=6>Key Programmes</font>**

**Our Programmes enable our students to:**

*   develop a positive attitude towards Mathematics.
*   acquire the essential Mathematical concepts and skills for real-world situation.
*   develop the ability to reason logically and communicate Mathematics.
*   harness Mathematical tools and technology in the learning and application of Mathematics.

**Programmes to ENABLE:**

*   ICAN (Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy): levels up confidence and achievement of low progress students.
*   Learning Support for Mathematics (P1 – P2): provides early support for Primary One and Two students who have weak basic numeracy skills during Mathematics lessons in smaller groups. The programme focuses on basic Mathematics skills and concepts to build good foundation in students.
*   MBL (Mastery Based Learning) (P1 – P4): provides support for students who have weak basic numeracy after school.
