<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Harnessing ICT to transform teaching and learning to thrive in the 21st
century.</p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>Moulding an ICT empowered, Responsible and Active Community of Learners</p>
<h3><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h3>
<p>In Qihua Primary School, we believe in preparing our students to be technology-empowered
learners, future-ready leaders and community champions in life. Therefore,
the ICT department aims to create an ICT enriched environment, providing
opportunities for our students to be joyful and responsible digital learners
through a range of quality learning experiences based on the 4Es (enable,
engage, enrich, empower) with technology.</p>
<h4><strong>Objectives of our programmes:</strong></h4>
<p>1. Enable students to demonstrate 21st CC skills through self-directed
and collaborative learning
<br>2. Develop in the students critical and reflective thinking, computational
thinking and ICT skills for the future workforce
<br>3. Enable students to contribute to the community leveraging on technology</p>
<h4><strong>Engaging the mass</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Enhanced version of the Improving Computer Literacy among Pupils Programme (ICLAP+):</strong>
</p>
<p>The ICLAP+ focuses on teaching pupils the baseline ICT skills and good
Cyberwellness practices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>ICLAP+ aims to enable students to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Curate by conducting internet searches and organise the digital information
for ease of retrieval, verify the accuracy, credibility and currency of
a piece of information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create through selecting and putting together different media elements
to construct a digital artefact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect through exchanging digital information with others synchronously
and asynchronously</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Enabling budding learners</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Cyberwellness</strong>
</p>
<p>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users.
It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to
protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW is to help students to become
responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, students should
demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible
use. Students should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology
for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive
use of technology for the good of the community.</p>
