and lunch breaks. Through engaging in activities such as basketball, badminton,
skipping and table tennis, students develop physical skills while having
fun.</p>

in the face of challenges, demonstrate team spirit and develop core values

<p><strong>3) P5 Camp</strong>
</p>
<p>During the Primary 5 Annual Camp, students participate in an array of
outdoor activities that are thoughtfully designed to nurture collaboration,
problem-solving, and resilience. These activities challenge students to
communicate effectively, work together, and support one another in overcoming
obstacles.</p>
<p>Over the immersive experience of three days and two nights, students step
out of their comfort zones to live independently, away from home for the
first time. Throughout the camp, students learn to appreciate the importance
of looking out for one another, respecting different perspectives, persevering
through challenges, and taking responsibility for their actions — all essential
qualities that contribute to their holistic growth as individuals and members
of the school community.</p>
