**Our Pavilion Garden**

There are two seating areas with black boards which become our outdoor classrooms. Some lessons for the various subjects and our signature e-trail are conducted at these areas. Things in nature become our manipulatives when conducting some of our experiments.

**Our Eco-Haven**

There are different areas in this garden and that is what makes it special. For example, there is the cactus plot where students can learn more about the soil type and the features of cactus plants, an alignment to the P6 topic on Adaptation as well as Characteristics of the Environment. The availability of different types of fauna found in this garden makes it a ‘must-go’ when teachers teach the topics of plants at P3 and P5.

**Our Greenarium**

The name “Greenarium” is based on the latin word _vivarium_ which means a place of life. And the two key features of our garden are the green spaces and the aquarium. These allow students to understand common plants and the pond ecosystem better.
