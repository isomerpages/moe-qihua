Museum Based Learning (MBL) is a compulsory module for all Primary 4 students. This year, we will take the primary 4 students on a virtual tour to the National Gallery Singapore (NGS) as part of a pilot program jointly conducted by MOE (Arts Education Branch and Guidance Branch) and NGS. Students will venture through an art trail online, guided by docents from NGS. Students will get the opportunity to observe, analyze artworks and engage in art discussion.

**1)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**P4 and 6 Digital Photography Workshop**

Selected P4 and P6 students went through a Digital Photography workshop led by an experienced photographer. They had the opportunity to handle a DSLR camera, learn more about its functions and techniques on how to take creative photographs. The students had lots of fun discovering new things about photography and were given opportunities to put their skills to the test as they were assigned the role of the student photographer at school events.
