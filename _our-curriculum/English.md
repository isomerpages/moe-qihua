**<font size=5>Engaging the mass</font>**


**1) STELLAR**

The department adopts the STELLAR (STrategies for English Language Learning And Reading) approach in the teaching and learning of English language. STELLAR 2.0 aims to strengthen students’ foundation in both receptive and productive skills and knowledge of the language through:

• explicit teaching of grammar, oracy as well as critical and close reading skills  
• strengthening the reading-writing connection  
• extensive reading and differentiated focused lessons  
• strategies including the Shared Book Approach, supported reading, KWL and retelling

**2) Reading and Library Programme**

Our school collaborates with the National Library Board to conduct mass-borrowing and assembly programmes. The department strives to instill the good habit of reading through school library visits and reading-related class activities. The department also works closely with parents to encourage our students to read through reading challenges.

**3) myON**

Through the use of myON, an online reading platform, all our primary 1 to 5 students are able to have their reading ability assessed in terms of the Lexile level. Students are then recommended a list of appropriate reading materials available in the school or national library. By reading books that are suitable for them and taking part in quizzes, students find the motivation to read and improve in their literacy skills.

**4) English Fiesta**

This yearly event consists of activities that provide students with joyful learning experiences. Students get the chance to apply their language skills in a fun and authentic way.
