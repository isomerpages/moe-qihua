<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Every Qihuaian an effective communicator with a passion for the English
Language</p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>To enhance pupils’ mastery of the English Language through quality teaching
and learning</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p>At Qihua, we implement the National Curriculum, STELLAR 2.0, which seeks
to develop students into empathetic communicators, discerning readers,
and creative inquirers.
<br>
<br>STELLAR 2.0 aims to strengthen students’ foundation in both receptive
and productive skills and knowledge of the language through:</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; explicit teaching of grammar, oracy as well as
critical and close reading skills</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; strengthening the reading-writing connection</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; extensive reading and differentiated focused lessons</p>
<p>• &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; strategies including the Shared Book Approach,
supported reading, KWL and retelling
<br>
<br>Together with the department’s key programme, Qihua’s English curriculum
aims to empower students to use the English language with impact and to
express themselves competently and confidently.
<br>
</p>
<h3><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h3>
<h4>Engaging the mass</h4>
<p><strong>1) Fostering a Culture of Reading<br></strong>Our school actively
promotes reading through book promotion initiatives and participation in
National Library Board (NLB) programmes, such as the Book Bug Challenge,
to spark students' interest in books. School library visits and engaging
reading-related activities seek to cultivate lifelong reading habits.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2) Enhancing Reading Through MyON<br></strong>To nurture a love
for reading and support independent learning, our Primary 1 to 3 students
have access to myON, an interactive online reading platform. Myon enables
students to receive personalised recommendations for eBooks based on their
reading proficiency. With engaging features such as audio narration, an
integrated dictionary, and quizzes, myON empowers students to read with
confidence, and develop an interest in reading.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3) Developing Critical Thinkers Through WhatsUp<br></strong>Our
Primary 4 to 6 students subscribe to WhatsUp, a student newspaper that
enriches their English learning by providing real-world contexts for meaningful
discussions on contemporary issues. Through exposure to current affairs,
they expand their vocabulary while developing civic, global, and cultural
literacy. Our Qihuaians have taken their learning further by actively responding
to articles, with selected pieces published by the editor.</p>

<p><strong>4) Celebrating the Joy of Language</strong>
</p>
<p>The English Fiesta is an exciting annual event held over two weeks in
Term 2, designed to ignite students' love for the English language. Through
exposure to diverse genres, such as poetry, biographies, and more, as well
as thrilling English games, students experience the richness of language
in a fun and engaging way. The excitement builds as they participate in
quizzes and celebrate their peers' literary creations, fostering a vibrant
reading and writing culture in our school.</p>

<h4>Enabling Budding Learners</h4>

<h4>Enriching Learning Experiences</h4>
<p><strong>1) Enhancing Communication Through Enrichment Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>Selected Primary 3 to 5 students participate in enrichment programmes
such as Speech and Drama, Debate, and Public Speaking. These programmes,
carefully designed to align with the English curriculum, extend learning
beyond the classroom while honing students’ communication and public speaking
skills. Through these experiences, students with high readiness develop
confidence and express themselves more effectively in various settings.</p>

<p><strong>2) Broadening Perspectives Through Literature<br></strong>At Qihua,
we cultivate critical and creative thinking through literature. Selected
Primary 3 and 4 classes explore rich texts, literary devices, and character
analysis during literature lessons. At Primary 5, advanced readers engage
in Reading Circles, a Gifted Education Branch initiative, deepening their
understanding through structured discussions.</p>

<p><strong>3) Nurturing Talented Communicators</strong>
</p>
<p>Selected students across levels represent our school in external competitions
such as the Plain English Speaking Awards (PESA) and National Writing Competition.
Proficient writers are also invited to join the Primary 5 Creative Writing
Programme by the Gifted Education Branch, where they refine their skills
under the guidance of teacher mentors, learning to craft compelling and
engaging stories.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>4) Budding Authors Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Budding Authors Programme aims to provide an avenue for proficient
writers to explore and express their abilities in a collaborative and creative
setting. Since 2021, Qihua has embarked on 3 projects. Our young writers
co-authored 2 series of books with their peers from Xingnan Primary School.
The budding authors went through authentic learning experiences such as
learning journeys. The latest project involved interviewing Mdm Halimah
Yacob and writing books about her childhood!</p>
