**<font size=5>Key Programmes</font>**

**<font size=5>Engaging the mass</font>**


**1) STELLAR**

The department adopts the STELLAR (STrategies for English Language Learning And Reading) approach in the teaching and learning of English language. STELLAR 2.0 aims to strengthen students’ foundation in both receptive and productive skills and knowledge of the language through:

• explicit teaching of grammar, oracy as well as critical and close reading skills  
• strengthening the reading-writing connection  
• extensive reading and differentiated focused lessons  
• strategies including the Shared Book Approach, supported reading, KWL and retelling

**2) Reading and Library Programme**

Our school collaborates with the National Library Board to conduct mass-borrowing and assembly programmes. The department strives to instill the good habit of reading through school library visits and reading-related class activities. The department also works closely with parents to encourage our students to read through reading challenges.

**3) myON**

Through the use of myON, an online reading platform, all our primary 1 to 5 students are able to have their reading ability assessed in terms of the Lexile level. Students are then recommended a list of appropriate reading materials available in the school or national library. By reading books that are suitable for them and taking part in quizzes, students find the motivation to read and improve in their literacy skills.

**4) English Fiesta**

This yearly event consists of activities that provide students with joyful learning experiences. Students get the chance to apply their language skills in a fun and authentic way.

**<font size=5>Enriching the learning experiences</font>**

**1) APEX – High Achievers Programme**

Primary 3 to 5 students are selected to take part in enrichment programmes which include debate and persuasive writing, journalism and fractured fairy tales. These programmes, apart from being aligned and relevant to the English curriculum, extend students’ learning of the English language beyond the classroom.

**2) Literature Appreciation Programme for Primary 4 and 5**

In Qihua, we broaden the scope of English learning for our students by giving them the opportunities to think critically and creatively. The literature programmes tailored for selected Primary 4 and 5 students expose our students to rich texts and introduce them to a range of literary devices.

**3) What’s Up Newspaper**

Students from Primary 4 to 6 subscribe to the Whatsup newspaper which supports their learning of the English language. Through meaningful activities and discussions, students keep abreast of current affairs and expand their vocabulary.

**4) External Competitions**

Every year, students are chosen to participate in external competitions such as Wits and Words, PESA etc.
