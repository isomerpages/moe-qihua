<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Every Qihuaian an inquisitive and self-directed learner</p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>To equip students with skills and an inquisitive attitude towards the
learning of Science</p>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p>At Qihua, we are dedicated to nurturing students into confident and inquisitive
learners. Our approach is centered on hands-on, inquiry-based learning
where students are empowered to explore the world around them.</p>
<p>The Qihua Science curriculum aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Develop a strong foundation in scientific knowledge and its application:</strong> Students
gain a clear understanding of key scientific concepts and apply them to
a variety of contexts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Foster a spirit of inquiry:</strong> We encourage students to ask
questions, collaborate with their peers, make predictions, and test their
ideas through hands-on experiments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connect science to everyday life:</strong> Our lessons help students
relate scientific phenomena to their daily lives and recognise the impact
of science in the world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Promote self-directed learning:</strong> Alongside reflection and
thinking routines, we leverage EdTech tools like Wayground, SLS, and Snorkl
to help students learn from feedback, take ownership of their progress,
and strive for excellence.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Engaging the mass</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Learning Journeys (Physical and Virtual)</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe that learning extends beyond the classroom. Our department
curates a range of physical and virtual learning journeys that immerse
students in rich, authentic environments, allowing them to see science
in action and deepen their learning experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Living Classrooms (Greenarium and Butterfly Garden)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school has various green spaces such as the ‘Greenarium’ and a Butterfly
Garden which also acts as a sensory trail. These green spaces provide an
authentic environment for scientific discovery. Here, students move beyond
the textbook to conduct hands-on observations of different ecosystems,
investigate common plant types, and witness the captivating life cycle
of a butterfly firsthand. This immersive experience makes learning tangible
and nurtures a deeper appreciation for the natural world.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>SPARKLE kits</strong>
</p>
<p>To enhance hands-on learning, we utilise SPARKLE (Science Pack - Activity
Resource Kits for Learning) kits developed by the Ministry of Education
(MOE) and the Science Centre Singapore, as well as extension activities
designed by our department. These activities provide students with "hands-on,
minds-on" opportunities to actively explore and test scientific ideas,
strengthening both their knowledge and process skills.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Enabling budding learners</strong></h4>
<p>
<br><strong>Science Revision Padlet</strong>
</p>
<p>To support self-directed revision, the Qihua Science department has curated
a comprehensive Padlet for Primary 3 to 6 students. It features fun, bite-sized
practices, including flashcards for key terms and exam-style questions
to apply concepts. A mastery mode provides instant feedback, helping students
learn from their errors and build confidence at their own pace.</p>
<h4><strong>Enriching the learning experiences</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Project Skills Workshop for Primary 4 &amp; 5 Students</strong>
</p>
<p>This workshop develops students into true scientific inquirers by equipping
them with essential investigative skills, from forming a hypothesis to
drawing conclusions. Our differentiated approach provides Primary 4 students
with structured guidance on assigned topics to build a strong foundation.
To stretch their abilities, Primary 5 students are guided to research and
select their own project topics, fostering greater independence and preparing
them for advanced scientific challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>STEAM Workshop for Primary 6 Students</strong>
</p>
<p>Our S.T.E.A.M. program engages students in hands-on projects where they
design and create a fun toy or item in each lesson. By integrating Science,
Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics, students sharpen their
critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Through exciting projects
like building Sled Kites and Rubber Band Powered Cars, students see concepts
like aerodynamics and energy conversion come to life, taking home their
creations as a tangible reminder of their learning.</p>
<p>Through this holistic and inquiry-driven approach, the Qihua Science Department
aims to do more than just teach science; we aspire to spark a lifelong
curiosity in every student. We are committed to nurturing our young learners
into inquisitive and self-directed individuals, ready to explore, understand,
and make a positive impact on the world around them.</p>
