**<font size="5">Key Programmes</font>**

**<font size="5">Engaging the mass</font>**


**1) Character Education Using Behaviour Standards**

Qihua Primary School uses Behaviour Standards from a well-known secular Chinese Classics to teach children character development and good behaviour. The Behaviour Standards emphasises on the basic requisites for being a good person and guidelines for living in harmony with others. The Behaviour Standards cover the same core values found in MOE R3ICH values – Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony. In our efforts to promote Character Education, Qihua Primary School also engages parents and students by inviting them to a series of Character Education Sharing Sessions conducted in English and Chinese.

**2) Start It Right**

Start It Right is our school-based Character and Citizenship Education programme. The packages are created in-house and activities include lessons which help students to understand the National anthem and pledge, the school’s mission, vision and values and school and class rules. The other activities address issues such as transition from holidays to school, positive affirmations, student leadership training and gathering of information about students’ well-being. In addition, teachers bond with students during interaction activities.

The first day of the term is set aside for teachers to set the tone for joyful learning and creating a caring and safe environment for both teachers and students. The programme provides quality interaction time between form teachers and students. It also enables teachers to observe and assess their students’ behaviour and use “teachable moments” to impart values and SEL skills (self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship management &amp; responsible decision-making) in them.

**3) End It Well**

End It Well includes an end-of-school-year party as a celebration of a community of learners who have grown into a cohesive classroom team. It is a fun and meaningful way to wrap the year as students have spent a lot of time together and every class has developed a distinct group personality. Students and teachers party with food, share their feelings and relive favourite memories with one another.

**<font size="5">Enabling budding learners</font>**

**1) Care For Buddy**

To help our Primary 1 students to adapt to primary school life, each Primary 1 student is assigned to a Primary 4 buddy. Care for Buddy provides a platform for our Primary 4 students to practise care for their juniors as well as develop their leadership skills. At the same time, the Primary 4 students could also develop social awareness and demonstrate interpersonal skills to build and maintain positive relationships with others.

**2) HatBITS**

In Qihua, we always believe in establishing rules and routines as this encourages positive behaviours. This is done by enforcing consistency through role-modelling and guiding by the adults in school. We have a structure in place to mindfully teach, practise and reinforce habits. Some of the focuses include greeting, movement, self-management, time management, behavourial standards etc. Curriculum time is factored into the timetable of our Primary 1 to 3 students to teach these focuses explicitly and students get to reflect on their own progress through a semestral self-assessment.

**1) Overseas Learning Experiences (OLE)**

Overseas Learning Journeys are organised to broaden our students’ global vision and develop their understanding and appreciation of what they have in Singapore. Going overseas without their parents will promote team bonding among the participants and enable them to develop independence, resilience and adaptability.

**2) International Collaborative Classrooms Project (ICCP)**

Globalisation and technological advancements are some of the key driving forces of the future. Qihua Primary School is committed to help its students develop the necessary competencies to thrive in a fast-changing world. Hence, our collaboration with Higashidai Elementary School provides our students with opportunities to communicate effectively and forge global friendships with peers though technology.

**3) Distribution Events**

As part of our outreach efforts to our community, we collaborate with the Woodlands Community Centre on two distribution events – Mandarin Orange and National Day Distributions. Through these events, our students learn to demonstrate the importance of caring, sharing and giving. Students are also given the opportunities to understand the community better and build relationships with people around them.
