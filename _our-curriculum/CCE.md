<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Every Qihuaian — grounded in values, ready to serve.</p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>To provide quality learning experiences that empower students with the
competencies to thrive in the 21st century.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Engaging the mass</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1) Character Education Through Behaviour Standards</strong>
</p>
<p>At Qihua Primary School, we adopt <em>Behaviour Standards</em> — derived
from a well-regarded secular Chinese classic — to guide our students in
character development and the cultivation of positive behaviour. These
standards focus on the fundamental principles of being a good individual
and provide practical guidance for living harmoniously with others.</p>
<p>The values embedded within the Behaviour Standards are closely aligned
with MOE’s R3ICH values: Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity,
Care, and Harmony.</p>
<p>To strengthen the partnership between school and home, we also invite
parents to join us in a series of Parenting Sharing Sessions, where we
exchange ideas and strategies for nurturing values at home.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2) Start It Right&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Start It Right</em> is Qihua Primary School’s school-based Character
and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme. Designed in-house, the programme
includes engaging lessons and activities that help students understand
the significance of the National Anthem and Pledge, the school’s Mission,
Vision, and Values, as well as class and school rules.</p>
<p>The activities also address important areas such as transitioning from
holidays to school, positive affirmations, student leadership development,
and the gathering of student well-being information. Through interactive
activities, teachers are also given opportunities to bond meaningfully
with their students.</p>
<p>The first day of each school term is specially set aside for teachers
to set a positive tone for the term—one that promotes joyful learning and
nurtures a caring and safe environment for all. This dedicated time allows
for quality teacher-student interaction, where teachers can observe students’
behaviour, assess their needs, and make use of teachable moments to reinforce
core values and Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) skills such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Self-awareness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self-management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social awareness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relationship management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responsible decision-making

</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3) End It Well&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><em>End It Well</em> is a year-end celebration that marks the culmination
of a shared journey among a community of learners. As students and teachers
reflect on their time together, each class—having grown into a cohesive
and unique team—comes together to celebrate their achievements and relationships.</p>
<p>The celebration typically includes food, laughter, and meaningful moments
of sharing. Students and teachers relive their favourite memories, express
their feelings, and enjoy a joyful closure to the school year. It is a
fun and heartfelt way to honour the growth, friendships, and classroom
spirit that have developed throughout the year.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Enabling Budding Learners</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1) Care For Buddy&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>To support our Primary 1 students in adjusting to primary school life,
each of them is paired with a Primary 4 buddy. Through the Care for Buddy
programme, Primary 4 students are given the opportunity to care for their
juniors while developing leadership, empathy, and interpersonal skills.
The experience also promotes social awareness as they learn to build and
sustain positive relationships.</p>
<p>This buddy system extends across the levels as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Primary 2 students are paired with Primary 5 buddies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primary 3 students are paired with Primary 6 buddies</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This structured, school-wide approach nurtures a caring school culture,
strengthens peer support across levels, and helps all students grow into
confident and compassionate individuals.</p>

<p><strong>2) HatBITS&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>At Qihua, we believe that establishing clear rules and routines lays the
foundation for positive behaviour. These expectations are consistently
reinforced through role-modelling and guidance by all adults in the school
community.</p>
<p>A structured approach is in place to intentionally teach, practise, and
reinforce positive habits. Key areas of focus include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Greeting etiquette</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Movement around the school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self-management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behavioural standards
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To support this, dedicated curriculum time is allocated for Primary 1
to 3 students to learn these routines explicitly. Students are also encouraged
to take ownership of their growth by engaging in semestral self-assessments,
where they reflect on their progress in developing these essential habits.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Enriching the Learning Experiences</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1) Overseas Learning Experiences (OLE)&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Overseas Learning Journeys are organised to broaden our students’ global
perspectives and deepen their appreciation for what they have in Singapore.
These experiences expose students to different cultures, customs, and ways
of life, helping them grow into more informed and empathetic global citizens.</p>
<p>Travelling without their parents also encourages team bonding among peers
and provides valuable opportunities for students to develop independence,
resilience, and adaptability—essential traits for thriving in a rapidly
changing world.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2) International Collaborative Classrooms Project (ICCP)&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Globalisation and rapid technological advancements are shaping the future
in powerful ways. At Qihua Primary School, we are committed to equipping
our students with the competencies they need to thrive in an ever-evolving
world.</p>
<p>As part of this effort, our collaboration with Higashidai Elementary School
offers students meaningful opportunities to communicate effectively and
forge global friendships with their peers—using technology as a bridge
across cultures. Through these exchanges, students develop confidence,
cross-cultural understanding, and a broader worldview.</p>
<p><strong>3) Distribution Events</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our outreach efforts to the community, Qihua Primary School
collaborates with Woodlands Community Centre on a Mandarin Orange distribution
event. This meaningful initiative provides students with the opportunity
to experience the values of caring, sharing, and giving in action.</p>
<p>Through their involvement, students gain a deeper understanding of the
community around them and learn to build positive relationships with others.
It is a valuable experience that nurtures empathy, social awareness, and
a strong sense of belonging.</p>
