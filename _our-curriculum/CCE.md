**1) Character Education Using Behaviour Standards**

Qihua Primary School uses Behaviour Standards from a well-known secular Chinese Classics to teach children character development and good behaviour. The Behaviour Standards emphasises on the basic requisites for being a good person and guidelines for living in harmony with others. The Behaviour Standards cover the same core values found in MOE R3ICH values â€“ Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony. In our efforts to promote Character Education, Qihua Primary School also engages parents and students by inviting them to a series of Character Education Sharing Sessions conducted in English and Chinese.
