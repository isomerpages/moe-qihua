**Engage**

1. **Curriculum CCA on Tuesdays**

All Primary 3 to Primary 6 students are strongly encouraged to participate in a CCA on Tuesdays from 2p.m. to 4 p.m. CCA is an excellent platform for students to develop character, learn values, social emotional competencies and skills to prepare them for future challenges. CCA brings students from diverse backgrounds together, forging friendships as they learn and interact with one another. Students are strongly encouraged to remain in their CCA throughout the 4 years to ensure continuity and deepen their learning.

2. **P3 Modular CCA Experience**

The P3 Modular CCA Programme is an introduction to CCA for all Primary 3 students. Students go through talent identification activities at various CCAs and also find out more about the CCAs in the school through slides and videos presented by the CCAs via the Student Learning Space (SLS) platform. After making an initial CCA selection, each student will attend an 8-week modular CCA experience where he/she will attend 2 CCAs of his/her choice. With this experience, students are able to participate and learn more about the activities at each CCA, allowing them to make an informed choice when they select their final CCAs at the end of the 8-week experience.

3. **P2 Young Champs CCA Programme**

Selected primary 2 students who have shown potential in sports, arts and music in the curricular lessons (PE lessons, music lessons) are identified to attend the P2 Young Champs CCA Programme. The selected Primary 2 students will join the Primary 3 to Primary 6 students for the curriculum CCA on Tuesdays in Semester 2, guided by the senior members.

4. **Internal School Performances**

Performing arts CCAs put up performances in school during festivals or celebrations (e.g. Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, Deepavali, National Day, etc). From practices to rehearsals and finally presenting and showcasing their skills in the Art form to their peers and teachers, students build and develop important life skills like resilience and confidence.

5. **External Community Performances**

Apart from internal school performances, performing arts CCAs are also invited to various external events yearly where they put up performances for the community. The enriching experiences in performing for a larger and wider audience help to develop students’ poise and self-confidence.

6. **Learning Journeys**

Various CCAs organize learning journeys for students to enrich their knowledge and experience. Learning journeys have different learning elements and learning experiences which the students may not be able to experience in the CCA activities in school. These learning journeys include visits to Esplanade to watch musicals, Gardens by the Bay to learn more about plants, etc.

7. **Additional CCA Practices**

Selected students are identified to attend additional CCA practices after curriculum hours. The additional CCA practices are planned for students to prepare them for upcoming performances, competitions and activities. Students learn more in depth and advanced skills and concepts in additional CCA practices on top of the basic and fundamental skills which they learn on Curriculum CCA days on Tuesdays.

8. **National School Games**
